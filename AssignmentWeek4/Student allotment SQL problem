Problem Statement:
A college needs to develop a system to allocate Open Elective Subjects to its respective students. 
The way the system would work is that each student is allowed 5 choices with the respective preference, where number 1 indicates the first preference, 
number 2 indicates second preference and so on, the subjects are supposed to be allotted on the basis of the Studentâ€™s GPA,
which means the student with the students with the highest GPAs are allotted the subject they want. 
Every subject has a limited number of seats so if a subject has 60 seats and all of them are filled then the student would not be allotted his first preference but instead second would be checked, 
if the second preference is full as well then the third preference would be checked, this process would be repeated till the student is allotted a subject of his/her choice. 
If in case all the preferences that the student has selected are already full, then the student would be considered as unallotted and would be marked so. 
For example, Mohit has filled his 5 choices with the respective preferences and they are as following:

The below table has the subject to student mapping with the preference
Note: StudentId and SubjectId are foreign keys in this table.
Constraints: A single Student cannot select the same subject twice.
